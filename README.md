Calculator that can only add and subtract. 

Check off a number first, then click add or subtract to add and subtract from the current value stored in memory. 

When a number is checked it disables all other numbers. When an operation is checked it disables all other operations.

Each time you check the box for add or subtract, it will increment or decrement the selected value. 

EX: You want to add 5 + 4. 

1. Check the 5 box. Then check the + box. -> Current Value is now 5.

2. Uncheck the 5 box then check the 4 box. Check the + box after this.  -> Current Value will now be 9.


Click the "Current Value" button to check what the current value is. 

Click the "C" to reset the Current Value back to 0.
